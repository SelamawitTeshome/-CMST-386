      Training and User Guidance
    </h1>
    <p>
      Training and user guidance are critical components of the successful
      adoption of any new application, especially a change request application.
      In this article, we will outline some subtopics that can be covered to
      ensure that users can efficiently and effectively use a change request
      application to request and manage changes to documents or systems.Training
      and User Guidance for a change request application can help ensure that
      users are able to effectively use the application to request and manage
      changes to documents or systems. Some subtopics that could be covered in
      this training include:
    </p>

    <h4>Overview of the Application</h4>
    <p>
      The first step in training users on a change request application is to
      provide an overview of the application. This should include an
      introduction to the application, its purpose, and the key features that
      users will need to understand to use the application effectively. This
      section could also cover how to navigate through the application and where
      to find important information.
    </p>
    <h4>Creating a Change Request</h4>
    <p>
      Creating a new change request is the core function of a change request
      application, so it's essential that users understand how to create a new
      request. This section should cover all the required fields that need to be
      completed when creating a new request, such as the change description,
      change reason, and change impact. Users should also be shown how to attach
      relevant documents or files to the request, such as a business case or
      technical specifications.
    </p>
    <h4>Reviewing and Approving Change Requests</h4>
    <p>
      Once a change request is submitted, it needs to go through a review and
      approval process. This section should cover how to review and approve
      change requests, including how to view and respond to requests as they
      come in. Users should be shown how to view the details of each request and
      how to provide comments or feedback. It's also important to explain the
      approval process and who is responsible for approving each request.
    </p>
    <h4>Tracking Changes</h4>
    <p>
      Even with proper training and guidance, users may encounter issues while
      using the change request application. This section should cover common
      issues that users may encounter and provide guidance on how to resolve
      these issues. This could include information on how to contact technical
      support or a help desk for assistance.
    </p>
    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
    <p>
      Even with proper training and guidance, users may encounter issues while
      using the change request application. This section should cover common
      issues that users may encounter and provide guidance on how to resolve
      these issues. This could include information on how to contact technical
      support or a help desk for assistance.
    </p>
    <h4>Best Practices</h4>
    <p>
      Finally, it's important to provide users with best practices for using the
      change request application. This could include tips on how to write
      effective change descriptions or how to provide the right level of detail
      in a change request. Users should also be provided with information on how
      to ensure that change requests are submitted in a timely manner and how to
      follow up on requests that have not been addressed.
    </p>
    <h4>
      By providing training and user guidance on these subtopics, users can feel
      more confident and comfortable using the change request application,
      leading to more accurate and effective change management processes. This,
      in turn, can help organizations to achieve their goals more efficiently
      and with less risk.
