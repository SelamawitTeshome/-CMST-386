      The importance of responsive design lies in its ability to ensure that a website or application is visually appealing and functional across various devices. This impacts the target audience positively as it allows them to access the content and features of a website or app seamlessly, regardless of the device they are using. Responsive design enhances user experience, increases engagement, and fosters customer satisfaction, leading to better conversion rates and business outcomes.
